## How to Run

1. Download [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Download [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your phone. If you have an iPhone you will need a Mac.
3. In the project directory, run `npm run ios/android` depending on your device.

## Collaboration

1. All changes you make should be on your own git branch.
2. Before making changes, do `git checkout -b name`. Ex `git checkout -b michael`.
3. After changes are complete, `git add . && git commit -m 'description of changes'`
4. After commiting your changes `git checkout main && git pull`.
5. Then, `git merge name`. Ex `git merge michael`.
6. If there's a merge conflict just ask the discord about it. If you feel that you can handle the conflict yourself go ahead just don't erase someone else's code please.
7. If there's no merge conflict go ahead and just `git push`.
